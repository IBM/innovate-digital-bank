# About
Innovate is a dummy digital bank composed of a set of microservices that communicate with each other; created to demonstrate cloud-native web apps.

[A live version deployed on a kubernetes cluster in IBM Cloud is available for you try here](http://184.173.1.59:30060/).
To test it out, sign up for an account. A process runs periodically to dump randomized transactions and bills for user accounts, so give it a couple of minutes and refresh to see your populated profile. Otherwise, you can insert, modify & delete your own transactions, bills or accounts by directly invoking the APIs described in the [docs](#docs).

![Demo architecture](docs/flow.png)

# Guide: Deploying on IBM Cloud Private

## Creating an instance of MongoDB
This demo heavily depends on mongo as a session & data store.

#### 1. Create a persistent volume
Give it a name and a capacity, choose storage type _**Hostpath**_, and add a _**path parameter**_

![Persistent Volume](docs/1.png)

#### 2. Create a persistent volume claim
Give it a name and a storage request value

![Persistent Volume Claim](docs/2.jpg)

#### 3. Create and configure mongo
From the catalog, choose MongoDb. Give it a **_name_**, specify the **_existing volume claim name_**, and give it a *_password_*

![Mongo](docs/3.jpg)

![Mongo](docs/4.jpg)

#### 4. Get your mongo connection string
Your mongo connection string will be in the following format:
```
mongodb://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>:<PORT>/<DATABASE_NAME>
```

Almost all your microservices need it; keep it safe!

## Configuring your Environment Variables
Each of the 8 microservices must have a _**.env**_ file.

An example is already provided within each folder. From the directory of each microservice, copy the example file, rename it to _**.env**_, and fill it with the appropriate values.

For example, from within the /innovate folder, navigate into the accounts folder

```
cd accounts
```

Next, copy and rename the _**.env.example**_ folder

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Finally, edit your .env folder and add your Mongodb connection string

#### Repeat those steps for all microservices. In addition to your mongo url, the portal microservice will need the address of your ICP.

## Deploying all Components
#### 1. Add your ICP's address to your hosts file
Add an entry to your /etc/hosts file as follows

```
<YOUR_ICP_IP_ADDRESS> mycluster.icp
```

#### 2. Login to docker

```
docker login mycluster.icp:8500
```

#### 3. Configure kubectl
From your ICP's dashboard, copy the kubectl commands under ***REMOVED*** > configure client

![kubectl config](docs/5.png)

#### 4. Deploy
Finally, navigate to each microservice, and run the following command
```
bx dev deploy
```
_If you don't have the IBM Cloud Developer Tools CLI installed, get it [here](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/reference/bluemix_cli/download_cli.html) first_

# Guide: Deploying on IBM Cloud Platform

_This guide requires a paid/upgraded account on IBM Cloud. You **cannot** complete the steps with a free or lite account_

#### Download the [IBM Cloud Developer Tools CLI](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/reference/bluemix_cli/get_started.html#getting-started)

#### Download the [Kubernetes CLI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/prereqs/)

#### Install the container service plugin

```
bx plugin install container-service -r Bluemix
```

## Creating a cluster

#### 1. Login to [IBM Cloud](https://console.bluemix.net).
#### 2. From the catalog, find **Containers in Kubernetes Clusters** and click create
#### 3. Choose a region and a cluster type, and create your cluster.
#### 4. Allow your cluster some time to deploy.

![kubectl config](docs/9.png)

## Creating an instance of MongoDB
This demo heavily depends on mongo as a session & data store.

#### 1. From the [catalog](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/), find **Compose for MongoDB** and click create

![kubectl config](docs/10.png)

#### 3. Give it a name, choose a region, pick the standard pricing plan and click create.
#### 4. Get your mongo connection string

![kubectl config](docs/11.png)

Almost all your microservices need it; keep it safe!

## Configuring your Application

### Setting your deploy target
Each of the 8 docker images needs to be pushed to your docker image registry on IBM Cloud. You need to set the correct _**deploy target**_.
Your url will be in the following format

```
registry.<REGION_ABBREVIATION>.bluemix.net/<YOUR_NAMESPACE>/<YOUR_IMAGE_NAME>
```

For example, to deploy the accounts microservice to my docker image registry in the US-South region, my deploy_target will be:

```
registry.ng.bluemix.net/amalamine/innovate-accounts
```
#### to get your namespace, run:

```
bx cr namespace-list
```

From the directory of each microservice, replace the deploy target in ***cli-config.yml*** & in ***/chart/innovate-<MICROSERVICE_NAME>/values.yaml*** with the correct one

For example, from within the /innovate folder, navigate into the accounts folder

```
cd accounts
```

Next, edit line 58 of [cli-config.yaml](https://github.com/aamine0/innovate-digital-bank/blob/master/accounts/cli-config.yml) file. Replace the ***deploy-image-target*** with the correct value.

```
deploy-image-target: "registry.ng.bluemix.net/amalamine/innovate-accounts"
```

![kubectl config](docs/12.png)

Edit line 6 of the [values.yaml](https://github.com/aamine0/innovate-digital-bank/blob/master/accounts/chart/innovate-accounts/values.yaml) file. Replace the ***repository*** with the correct value.

```
repository: registry.ng.bluemix.net/amalamine/innovate-accounts
```

![kubectl config](docs/13.png)

#### Repeat these steps for all microservices.

### Setting your environment variables
Each of the 8 microservices must have a _**.env**_ file.

An example is already provided within each folder. From the directory of each microservice, copy the example file, rename it to _**.env**_, and fill it with the appropriate values.

For example, from within the /innovate folder, navigate into the accounts folder

```
cd accounts
```

Next, copy and rename the _**.env.example**_ folder

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Finally, edit your .env folder and add your Mongodb connection string

#### Repeat these steps for all microservices. In addition to your mongo url, most will need the public IP address of your kubernetes cluster, _You can find that under the overview of your cluster on IBM Cloud_.

## Deploying all Components
#### 1. Login to IBM Cloud
Specify the region you've deployed your cluster in
```
bx login -a https://api.<REGION_ABBREVIATION>.bluemix.net
```

#### 2. Configure kubectl
Run the following command:

```
bx cs cluster-config <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>
```

Then copy the output and paste it in your terminal

#### 3. Initialize helm

```
helm init
```

#### 4. Deploy
Finally, navigate to each microservice, and run the following command
```
bx dev deploy
```

## (Optional) Adding Support with Watson Conversation
The support microservice connects to an instance of Watson Conversation on IBM Cloud to simulate a chat with a virtual support agent.

#### 1. Create an instance of Watson Conversation
From the [IBM Cloud Catalog](bluemix.net), choose Watson Conversation, and click create.

![Watson Conversation](docs/6.png)

#### 2. Import the support workspace
Import the [support workspace](/support/conversation-workspace.json) into your newly created Watson Conversation instance

![Watson Conversation](docs/7.png)

#### 3. Get your credentials
Navigate to the deploy tab and copy your username, password, and workspace ID

![Watson Conversation](docs/8.png)

#### 4. Edit your .env file
From within the support folder, edit your .env to include your newly acquired credentials

#### 5. Deploy
Redeploy the microservice, the support feature should now be accessible through the portal.

```
bx dev deploy
```
