# Building a Digital Bank with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, & Kubernetes

In this Code Pattern, we will build a dummy digital bank composed of a set of microservices that communicate with each other. We'll be using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and the IBM Cloud Container Service.

Development of [cloud native apps](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2017/05/15/developing-cloud-native-applications/) that are broken down into a set of [microservices](http://microservices.io/) has been praised and commended as best-practice in software development methodologies. Software stacks like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), which enable cloud native computing, have therefore picked up quite a bit of popularity.

It’s a little _(a lot)_ more fun, however, to build a so-called cloud native app, than to talk about one.

So here's our attempt:

We’ll take a use-case that has a bit of real-world familiarity to it — A digital bank. Naturally inspired by [Monzo](http://monzo.com/). Let’s call it Innovate.

[A live version deployed on a Kubernetes cluster in IBM Cloud is available for you to try here](http://ibm.biz/digibank).
To test it out, sign up for an account. A process runs periodically to dump randomized transactions and bills for user accounts, so give it a couple of minutes and refresh to see your populated profile.

## Learning objectives

When you've completed this Code Pattern, you will understand how to:

* Break an application down to a set of microservices
* Create and manage a Kubernetes cluster on IBM Cloud
* Deploy to a Kubernetes cluster on IBM Cloud
* Deploy to IBM Cloud Private

## Flow

When thinking of business capabilities, our imaginary bank will need the following set of microservices:

1. *Portal:* Loads the UI and takes care of user sessions and relies on all other microservices for core functionality.
2. *Authentication:* Handles user profile creation, as well as login & logout.
3. *Accounts:* Handles creation, management, and retrieval of a user’s banking accounts.
4. *Transactions:* Handles creation and retrieval of transactions made against users' bank accounts.
5. *Bills:* Handles creation, payment, and retrieval of bills.
6. *Support:* Handles communication with Watson Assistant to enable a support chat feature.

If you want a quick walkthrough of the end result, a video is available [here](https://ibm.box.com/s/fgpqiacn9ewaorgp8l97bnrk760s8rx3)

# Setup
You have multiple options to setup your own instance:
* [Deploy to IBM Cloud with one-click (automated via toolchain)](#deploy-to-ibm-cloud)
* [Run it locally](#run-locally)
* [Deploy to IBM Cloud the hard way (manual, multi-stage)](#deploy-to-ibm-cloud-the-hard-way)
* [Deploy to IBM Cloud Private](#deploy-to-ibm-cloud-private)

# Deploy to IBM Cloud
> NOTE: This is an automated setup & deployment to your own Kubernetes cluster hosted on IBM Cloud; it packages all 7 microservice as one docker image, one deployment, and one multi-port service. To get a better grasp of the concept, you should follow the steps to configure your cluster and deploy each microservice independently.

You can deploy this application using a [toolchain](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/toolchains/) by clicking on the Deploy button below. Note that you should have a cluster ready before you start. To deploy a new one, find _Containers in Kubernetes Clusters_ under the [IBM Cloud catalog](bluemix.net/catalog) and click create. Allow it some time to deploy.

[![Deploy to IBM Cloud](https://console.bluemix.net/devops/setup/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IBM/innovate-digital-bank)

## Analyze the results

Once all jobs in the delivery pipeline are completed, you'll be able to access the portal on _port 30200_ of your cluster's _worker node public IP address_.

To take a look at the resources now deployed to your Kubernetes cluster, navigate to the IBM Cloud Dashboard, find your cluster, and click on the Kubernetes dashboard button

![cluster overview](doc/source/images/14.png)

Once your Kubernetes dashboard has launched, switch to the correct namespace and observe the resources deployed to your cluster. You should have the following provisioned:

#### Persistent Volumes:
* *innovate-bank-mongodb:* a hostPath volume which mounts a directory from the host node’s filesystem into our pod, in which we can store all the data our digital bank requires to operate.

_[Read more about Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/)_

#### Persistent Volume Claims:
* *innovate-bank-mongodb:* requests persistent storage for our pods. Kubernetes uses the claim to look up its bound persistent volume. The volume is then exposed to the pod.

_[Read more about Persistent Volume Claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)_

#### ConfigMaps:
* *innovate-bank:* allows us to decouple configuration artifacts from image content to keep containerized applications portable. We use it to store data our app will need to run, like MongoDB's connection string, and backend endpoint paths.

_[Read more about ConfigMaps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/)_

#### Deployments:
* *innovate-bank:* describes the desired state of our app, creates and manages pods, used to take care of self-healing, restarts, updates, and rollbacks.
* *innovate-bank-mongodb:* describes the desired state of the MongoDB instance running in our cluster.

_[Read more about Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)_

#### Pods:
* *innovate-bank:* created by our app's deployment, pulls the app's docker image from your private container registry on IBM Cloud, and starts all microservices. It's bound to environment variables read from our ConfigMap, some set dynamically before deployment.
* *innovate-bank-mongodb:* created by MongoDB's deployment, pulls an official MongoDB image from a public repository, makes use of a persistent volume on your cluster.

_[Read more about Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/)_

#### Services:
* *innovate-bank:* exposes the app's deployment through multiple ports, one for each microservice.
* *innovate-bank-mongodb:* exposes MongoDB's deployment through a specified port, to be consumed be all microservices.

_[Read more about Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)_

# Run Locally

### 1. Clone the repo
Clone the `innovate-digital-bank` repository locally. In a terminal, run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/innovate-digital-bank.git
```

### 2. Create an Instance of MongoDB

This demo heavily depends on mongo as a session & data store.

From the [IBM Cloud catalog](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/), find **Compose for MongoDB** and click create. Give it a name, choose a region, pick the standard pricing plan and click create.

**Get your mongo connection string. Almost all your microservices need it; keep it safe!**

![kubectl config](doc/source/images/11.png)

### 3. Configure your environment variables

Each of the 7 microservices must have a _**.env**_ file that stores all credentials.

An example is already provided within each folder. From the directory of each microservice, copy the example file, rename it to _**.env**_, and fill it with the appropriate values.

For example, from within the **/innovate** folder, navigate into the accounts folder

```
$ cd accounts
```

Next, copy and rename the _**.env.example**_ folder

```
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Finally, edit your **.env** folder and add your Mongodb connection string

***Repeat these steps for all microservices. In addition to your mongo URL, most will need the public IP address of your Kubernetes cluster, _You can find that under the overview of your cluster on IBM Cloud_.***

### 4. Configure your environment mode
When running the app locally without Kubernetes, the microservices do not run on the NodePorts specified in our helm chart, so we need to point our portal and userbase microservices to the correct ports.

If you're running on macOS or any linux-based system, run the following in a terminal from the git repo's directory

```
$ export NODE_ENV=development
```

if you're running on Windows, edit the NODE_ENV attribute in your .env file from within the **/portal** folder and the **/userbase** folder to the following:

```
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 5. Run
Finally, navigate to each microservice folder, and start it. Make sure you run the 7 microservice in 7 separate terminals.

```
$ npm start
```

You can now visit `localhost:3100` to access the portal

# Deploy to IBM Cloud the Hard Way
> NOTE: This guide requires a paid/upgraded account on IBM Cloud. You **cannot** complete the steps with a free or lite account.

1. [Get the tools](#1-get-the-tools)
2. [Clone the repo](#2-clone-the-repo)
3. [Login to IBM Cloud](#3-login-to-ibm-cloud)
4. [Create a cluster](#4-create-a-cluster-)
5. [Create an instance of MongoDB](#5-create-an-instance-of-mongodb)
6. [Configure your deploy target](#6-configure-your-deploy-target)
7. [Configure your environment variables](#7-configure-your-environment-variables)
8. [Configure kubectl](#8-configure-kubectl)
9. [Initialize helm](#9-initialize-helm)
10. [Deploy](#10-deploy)

### 1. Get the tools
You'll need each of the following pre-requisites:
* [IBM Cloud Developer Tools CLI](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/reference/bluemix_cli/get_started.html)

* the [Kubernetes CLI](https://kubernetes.io/doc/source/images/user-guide/prereqs/)

* the container service plugin

once you've downloaded the IBM Cloud Developer Tools CLI, in a terminal, run:

```
$ bx plugin install container-service -r Bluemix
```

* the container registry plugin

in a terminal, run:

```
$ bx plugin install container-registry -r Bluemix
```
### 2. Clone the repo
Clone the `innovate-digital-bank` repository locally. In a terminal, run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/innovate-digital-bank.git
```
### 3. Login to IBM Cloud
Both through the [console](https://console.bluemix.net/) and your terminal
> NOTE: If you need to specify the region you want to deploy in, you can do so by adding the `-a` flag followed by the region URL.

```
$ bx login
```

### 4. Create a cluster

From the catalog, find **Containers in Kubernetes Clusters** and click create. Choose a region and a cluster type, and create your cluster. Allow it some time to deploy.

![kubectl config](doc/source/images/9.png)

### 5. Create an instance of MongoDB

This demo heavily depends on mongo as a session & data store.

From the [catalog](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/), find **Compose for MongoDB** and click create. Give it a name, choose a region, pick the standard pricing plan and click create.

**Get your mongo connection string. Almost all your microservices need it; keep it safe!**

![kubectl config](doc/source/images/11.png)


### 6. Configure your deploy target

Each of the 7 docker images needs to be pushed to your docker image registry on IBM Cloud. You need to set the correct _**deploy target**_.
Depending on the region you've created your cluster in, your url will be in the following format

```
registry.<REGION_ABBREVIATION>.bluemix.net/<YOUR_NAMESPACE>/<YOUR_IMAGE_NAME>
```

For example, to deploy the accounts microservice to my docker image registry in the US-South region, my **deploy_target** will be:

```
registry.ng.bluemix.net/amalamine/innovate-accounts
```

If you need to get your namespace, run:

```
$ bx cr namespace-list
```

You can also add a new namespace by running:

```
$ bx cr namespace-add <NAME>
```

From the directory of each microservice, replace the deploy target in ***cli-config.yml*** & in ***/chart/innovate-<MICROSERVICE_NAME>/values.yaml*** with the correct one

For example, from within the **/innovate** folder, navigate into the accounts folder

```
$ cd accounts
```

Next, edit line 58 of [cli-config.yaml](https://github.com/aamine0/innovate-digital-bank/blob/master/accounts/cli-config.yml) file. Replace the ***deploy-image-target*** with the correct value.

```
deploy-image-target: "registry.ng.bluemix.net/amalamine/innovate-accounts"
```

![kubectl config](doc/source/images/12.png)

Edit line 6 of the [values.yaml](https://github.com/aamine0/innovate-digital-bank/blob/master/accounts/chart/innovate-accounts/values.yaml) file. Replace the ***repository*** with the correct value.

```
repository: registry.ng.bluemix.net/amalamine/innovate-accounts
```

![kubectl config](doc/source/images/13.png)

**Repeat these steps for all 7 microservices.**

### 7. Configure your environment variables

Each of the 7 microservices must have a _**.env**_ file that stores all credentials.

An example is already provided within each folder. From the directory of each microservice, copy the example file, rename it to _**.env**_, and fill it with the appropriate values.

For example, from within the **/innovate** folder, navigate into the accounts folder

```
$ cd accounts
```

Next, copy and rename the _**.env.example**_ folder

```
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Finally, edit your .env folder and add your Mongodb connection string

***Repeat these steps for all microservices. In addition to your mongo URL, most will need the public IP address of your Kubernetes cluster, _You can find that under the overview of your cluster on IBM Cloud_.***

### 8. Configure kubectl

Run the following command:

```
$ bx cs cluster-config <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>
```

Then copy the output and paste it in your terminal

### 9. Initialize helm

```
$ helm init
```

### 10. Deploy
Finally, navigate to each microservice folder, and run the following command

```
$ bx dev deploy
```

Once done, you'll be able to access the portal on port _30200_ of your cluster's _public IP address_, which you can find under the overview of your cluster on IBM Cloud.

# Deploy to IBM Cloud Private

If you have an instance of IBM Cloud Private running, you can follow the steps below to deploy the app. If you'd like to deploy your own instance of ICP, [you can follow this great writeup](https://github.com/IBM/deploy-ibm-cloud-private).
